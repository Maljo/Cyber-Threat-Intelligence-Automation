TB_NTA.py   Threat Based - Network Traffic Analysis

This code connects to a your MISP instance using the PyMISP library and downloads IoCs tagged with "botnet" and "malware" that include an "ip-src" attribute type. It then captures network traffic for 1800 seconds, analyses each packet to check if it is an IP packet, and then checks if the source or destination IP address is in the list of IPs to monitor. If an IP address is found in the list, the code increments the packet count for that IP address in a dictionary. Finally, the code checks if any IP address has sent or received more than 10 packets, and prints a message if suspicious traffic is detected.

You can modify this code to detect other types of malicious traffic anomalies by analysing the packet headers and payloads, and looking for specific patterns or behaviors that indicate malicious activity
